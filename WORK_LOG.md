| November 1 |           4:00 - 5:00 pm            | I realized this is similar to the barcode scanner. Since the database size and number of queries can go up to 1,000,000, I think, like last assignment, we should use hashes. I also think I need a helper class for each key, taking the name and the value associated with it. I'm trying to figure out how my table should be composed; I'm thinking probably a big number so it can hold the key and value of many objects. I haven't made my table yet, but I figured out how to extract the key and value from each line. I am still wondering what to do for my table — I decided I'm going to use a table of KeyValue pairs with a key and a value, then put each line in the CSV's key and value inside the table.  I don’t know what happened, but my GitHub broke, so I have to make a new project file. |

I wonder what would happen if two pairs of values had associations with a single key, which would lead to potentially erasing the first one and replacing it with the second. For some reason, I have errors with adding key and values to the table, so I'll work on that next session. |




To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
